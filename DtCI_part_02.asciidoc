"Great fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite 'em,

And little fleas have lesser fleas, and so ad infinitum.

And the great fleas themselves, in turn, have greater fleas to go on;

While these again have greater still, and greater still, and so on."

- Augustus De Morgan, _A Budget of Paradoxes_

Having nailed down data structures in Part I, we turn to algorithms in Part II.
Algorithms are the rules, recipes, and procedures that work with data structures to transform values and logic into useful results.  

Algorithms are the procedures that software uses to manipulate data structures. They are the recipes that take in data and return a result. By the end of this part you will have a good understanding of the most commonly used algorithms, and a strong foundation for solving algorithmic problems in coding interviews.
