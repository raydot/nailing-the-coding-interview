Dear reader!  
You have reached Part III of the book. 
Hopefully you are as surprised to be here reading it as I am to be here writing it.
In this part we will cover some topics that are a little outside of the scope of the rest of the book.
Most will be more ideas or methods than actual data structures and algorithms in a traditional sense.
If you buckle in and keep your hands and feet inside the car at all time, absolutely no harm will come to you.
