## Priority Summary

### High Priority (23 images)
Fundamental concepts that significantly aid understanding:
- Arrays: basic structure, indexing
- Linked Lists: pointers, basic structure
- Stacks/Queues: structure and operations
- Heaps: basic structure
- Hashes: hash function visualization
- Trees: DOM example, traversals
- Graphs: types, traversals, Dijkstra's
- Sorting: quicksort, merge sort

### Medium Priority (11 images)
Helpful but not critical:
- Linked list operations
- Heap operations
- Tree insertion
- Graph examples
- Königsberg Bridge

### Low Priority (2 images)
Nice to have:
- Trie node detail
- Knight walk

---

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Create All Images
Use a tool like:
- **Excalidraw** (free, hand-drawn style)
- **draw.io** (free, professional diagrams)
- **Mermaid** (text-based diagrams in Markdown)
- **Python + Matplotlib** (programmatic diagrams)

### Option 2: Remove Placeholders
Simply remove the TK markers and rely on text descriptions

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
1. Create the 23 high-priority images
2. Remove medium/low priority placeholders
3. Add images later as time permits

### Option 4: Use AI Generation
- DALL-E, Midjourney, or similar for diagram generation
- May need manual cleanup/editing

## Image Style Guidelines

For consistency, all images should:
- Use a consistent color scheme
- Have clear labels
- Be readable at various sizes
- Use simple, clean designs
- Include alt text for accessibility

**Suggested palette:**
- Primary: #2E86AB (blue)
- Secondary: #A23B72 (purple)
- Accent: #F18F01 (orange)
- Background: #FFFFFF (white)
- Text: #2D3142 (dark gray)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Decide on approach** (create all, remove, or hybrid)
2. **Choose tool** for creating diagrams
3. **Create high-priority images first**
4. **Save images** to appropriate `images/ch_XX/` directories
5. **Update Markdown** to reference actual images
6. **Remove TK placeholders**
